Intro
=====
**WikiContrib** is a contribution data visualization tool which can be used to view
a developerâ€™s contributions from different contributing platforms to the Wikimedia
Foundation. Wikimedia Scholarship Committee can use this tool to decide who gets
scholarship to Wikimedia events, and Wikimedians can also share their contributions
profile with peers and employers.

Currently, it fetches the contributions from

1. Gerrit
2. Phabricator
3. Github

It visualizes the data in form of graphs and user contribution calendar. The tool
can also be used by anyone to view the contributions of any contributor in the Wikimedia Foundation.
