**WikiContrib** is a contribution data visualization tool which can be used to view a developerâ€™s contributions from different contributing platforms to the Wikimedia Foundation, designed to help the Scholarship Committee for reviewing applications for Wikimedia events.

Currently, it fetches the contributions from

1. Gerrit

It visualizes the data in form of graphs and user contribution calendar. The tool can also be used by anyone to view the contributions of any contributor in the Wikimedia Foundation.

**Note:** The tool was called **WikiContrib** during development. After the initial development phase, the tool was renamed to **WikiContrib**.
